# Free Code Camp

This repository contains all of my solutions to the free code camp curriculum. My top priority is to finish the newly added sections for the certifications I have already completed to get them out of legacy status. Once up-to-date, the completed certifications will be listed under the certifications section. Each section and certification will have a readme in it, if it makes sense to have one.
